# Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, which estimates the total value a customer will bring to a business over their entire relationship. By leveraging historical purchasing data, the goal is to identify high-value customers and support data-driven decision-making in marketing, retention, and resource allocation. The project uses the **Online Retail Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
🎯 Goal
To develop a predictive model for Customer Lifetime Value that:
- Identifies valuable customers early.
- Helps optimize marketing and retention strategies.
- Supports personalized customer engagement to increase long-term profitability.
📂 Dataset
Dataset: Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Key Features:
- InvoiceNo: Transaction ID
- StockCode: Product Code
- Quantity: Number of products purchased
- InvoiceDate: Transaction date
- UnitPrice: Price per unit
- CustomerID: Unique customer identifier
- Country: Customer’s country of residence

Target:
- Customer Lifetime Value (regression target).
🛠️ Skills & Techniques
- **RFM Analysis:** Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for customer segmentation.
- **Time-Based Feature Engineering:** Cohorts, purchase frequency, churn probability.
- **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² to assess predictive performance.
📌 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
2. Feature Engineering (RFM, time-based features, purchase patterns).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (customer distribution, revenue patterns).
4. Model Training (regression models for CLV prediction).
5. Model Evaluation (compare performance using regression metrics).
6. Business Insights (customer segmentation, marketing strategies).
✅ Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model for Customer Lifetime Value.
- Identification of high-value customers for targeted marketing.
- Customer segmentation using RFM and time-based features.
- Actionable business strategies to maximize long-term revenue.
